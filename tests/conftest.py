"""Shared pytest fixtures.

The API tests run the FastAPI app with ``dry_run=True`` so no Windows /
ActiveX dependencies are required. ``conftest.py`` keeps that switch
out of every individual test.

v1.1 note: ``enforce_claims=True`` is the production default and is
exercised here. The default ``client`` fixture pre-acquires a claim and
attaches ``X-Claim-Token`` to every subsequent request, so individual
tests behave as if claims didn't exist. Tests that need to exercise the
claim protocol itself (acquire/heartbeat/release, 423 enforcement,
advisory mode) use the more explicit fixtures below.

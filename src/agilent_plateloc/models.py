"""Lab equipment status spec v1.1.

This module is a verbatim copy of the unified status contract from the
ac-organic-lab monorepo (``docs/STATUS_SPEC.md`` for the v1.0 base and
``docs/STATUS_SPEC_v1_1.md`` for the v1.1 additions). It MUST stay in
sync with those documents until a shared ``lab-status-contract`` Python
package is published; once it is, replace this file with::

    from lab_status_contract import (
        EquipmentStatus, ProbeResponse, HealthResponse,
        ClaimRequest, ClaimResponse, ClaimRejection, ClaimedBy, ...
    )

Conformance: agilent_plateloc REST API conforms to lab status spec v1.1.
